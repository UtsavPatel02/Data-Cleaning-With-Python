Hi There! Welcome to the Customer Call-Back Data Cleaning Project!
In this project I showcase the power of Python for transforming a messy customer call-back dataset into a clean and analyzable format.



Project Overview
Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, I applied data-cleaning techniques to a disorganized dataset, making it orderly and usable. The refined data is now ready for in-depth analysis and visualization.
